# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview
Collect and analyze weather data for multiple cities around the world and provide recomendations for hotels based on client's weather preferences.

## Analysis
With this study we are able to determine if our client wants to stay in moderate to warmer climates, they should find a location near the equator. Furthermore, if looking for recomendations for hotels, there are numerous listed within a 5000m radius.

## Challenges
This was really challenging and long for how much time we had to complete. There were quite a bit of things that weren't taught and having to explore on our own did not give me much time to keep up with classwork and investigate new functions. This is my fault for not planning my time out better I guess.....I hope the next Module is more understandable.
